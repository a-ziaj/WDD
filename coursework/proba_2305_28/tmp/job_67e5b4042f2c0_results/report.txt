Conservation Analysis Report
===========================

Analysis Parameters:
- Window size: 4
- Alignment file: job_67e5b4042f2c0_aligned.aln
- Sequences: 0

Results Summary:
- Plotcon analysis: Success
- Shannon entropy analysis: Success

Interpretation Tips:
1. Low entropy regions (blue line) indicate conserved positions
2. High conservation scores (green line) show identical residues
3. Plotcon results show smoothed conservation over 4-residue windows

Suggested Actions:
- Check conserved regions against known domains in InterPro
- Examine variable regions for potential functional adaptations
